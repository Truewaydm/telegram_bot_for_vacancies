            Every day we analyze sites with vacancies, according to the settings of our subscribers.
             All eligible vacancies that have been published on these sites in the last 24 hours,
             are recorded in the database and sent to subscribers, according to their preferences.
             You can view current vacancies by simply selecting the required city or specialty.
             Or, after a simple <a href="{% url 'accounts:register' %}"> registration</a>,
             receive every day a letter with a list of new vacancies for the last 24 hours, according to your needs.
